 RSA Factoring Challenge

The goal of this assignment is to factor as many numbers as you can into a sum of two smaller numbers. Any assistance in making this project work for bignums (numbers larger than long, unsigned integers) would be very appreciated. It works flawlessly for that except in the case of bignums.
